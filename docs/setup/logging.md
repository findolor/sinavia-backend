# Logging Configuration

As described on [Configurations](be-setup-configurations.html) page, you can setup the logger on your environment file on `config/environments/<env>.js`. The logger used in this boilerplate is [Logger4js](http://npmjs.com/package/log4js) so refer to its [configuration documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/log4js#my_log4js_configurationjson) when setting the `logging` key on your environment file.
