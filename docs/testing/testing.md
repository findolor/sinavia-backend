# Testing

The default test suite of the boilerplate uses [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) as the testing framework and [Chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) for the assertions and [Sinon](Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks). They are located in the `test` folder in the root of the project and follow the same folder architecture as the `src` folder, except for the [functional tests](testing/black-box.md).
